            finded from source file-object.
        _datas (dict): Dictionnary of every rules returned by parser. This
            is not something you would need to reach commonly.
        _rule_attrs (list): List of registered reference rules. You may use
            it in iteration to find available reference attribute names.
        metas (dict): Dictionnary of every meta datas from manifest. Either filled by
            serializer (with ``load`` method) or dump content (with ``from_dict``
