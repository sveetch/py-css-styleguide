class RequirementBuilder:
    """
    Build requirements file content from requirements collected from a package
    metadata with support of extras (optional requirements).

    Package metadata format returned by importlib is not very simple to parse so this
    implementation is naive and won't support everything that could exists in Python
    packages:

    * It lacks of support for 'python_version' marker. Requirement defined with this
      will fail;
    * CVS url or local path for package won't be properly defined in requirement file
      with the right Pip option;

    Usage of importlib metadata is compatible with almost any package instead of the
    TOML way which is more efficient but only available with ``pyproject.toml``
    configuration.

    .. Hint::
        * Requirements file is the standard from Pip, commonly seen in a
          ``requirements.txt`` file;
        * Package metadata is the package configuration collected by setuptools during
          package installation. This collection comes from either ``setup.cfg``,
          ``setup.py`` or ``pyproject.toml`` depending from what package has used to
          define its configuration;
        * Extras requirements are optional requirements defined in package option
          ``options.extras_require``;

    Keyword Arguments:
        blocking (boolean): If False, any exception from parsing will not raise and
            instead print the error without blocking further script operations. If
            True, any exception from parsing are raised. Default to True.
